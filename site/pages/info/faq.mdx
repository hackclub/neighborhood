# Frequently Asked Questions

### What projects qualify? / Do I qualify?

If you complete 100 hours working on your app, you qualify.

## Working on Your Projects

### What if my work isn’t tracked by Hackatime (e.g., Figma)?

Use Stopwatch mode. Up to 20 of your 100 hours may be Stopwatch-tracked. Only active coding/design counts (not research or watching videos).

No, but it must be publicly usable (for example, a working website or app).

Yes, but you can spread hours across the week (including weekends). You must reach 40 hours total per week.

### Can I do fewer hours if I don’t need a flight stipend?

No. 100 hours are required regardless of stipend use.

### When do the 100 hours need to be completed?

Before you arrive in San Francisco. If you’re coming in early June, finish your hours by the end of May.

No, but you’re still welcome to build and participate remotely.
