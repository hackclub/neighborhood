# Neighborhood

Complete 100 hours of coding, and you’ll be able to stay in San Francisco for up to three months — for free!

1. Get onboarded to the community platform to become a full member.
2. Login on [https://hackatime.hackclub.com](https://hackatime.hackclub.com). Follow the tutorial to set up and start logging hours in whatever code editor you use.
3. Once Hackatime is set up, head to [https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/download](https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/download) or [https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/desktop](https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/desktop) and connect your project. Use the same email you used to sign up!
4. Read the intro letter to get a sense of the kind of projects you should make.
5. Start hacking! Work in your code editor and your hour count will go up.
6. Push your commits frequently. Create a devlog every 3–4 hours with a screen recording showing what you’ve built. Include a short video explanation and introduce yourself to the community.
7. At 50 hours, you can request a visa invitation letter.
8. At 100 hours, you’ll get the flight stipend! Start thinking about your travel dates. In-person Neighborhood runs June–August (minimum 2 weeks, maximum 3 months). Flight, food, and housing are covered.
9. There is no cap — everyone who hits 100 hours gets to come.
