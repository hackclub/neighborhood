# Travel stipends

### How they work:

For everyone who completes 100 hours of coding, Hack Club will provide a flight stipend of up to $500 for domestic flights and up to $750 for international flights. The goal is to cover at least half of the flight cost.

The stipend will only cover the cheapest reasonable flight option. If you choose to book a more expensive flight, you will be responsible for the difference.

Cheapest reasonable flight means the cheapest flight without a long layover. For example, if you have a flight for $90 but it includes a 10 hour layover, but another flight is $150 with a 2 hour layover, we will reimburse you for the more expensive flight.

If you would like to check bags, purchase travel insurance, etc. those will be your own responsibility to pay for.

The reimbursement will be provided after you arrive in San Francisco.
